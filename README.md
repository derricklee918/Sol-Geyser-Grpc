# How can I use Geyser support grpc in Solana Trading Bots?

Hello everyone,

The Solana Geyser gRPC provides an efficient solution for fetching blocks, transactions, and tracking new pool creations and balance changes on platforms like Pumpfun and Raydium DEX as processed by the validator.

This repository showcases four distinct methods—using Helius WebSocket, Hello Moon WebSocket, and gRPC WebSocket (provided by Helius)—to monitor newly created pools and real-time balance updates.

I have successfully implemented these methods in my Pump.fun and Raydium sniping projects.

If you need assistance with integrating these approaches into your projects, feel free to reach out to me.
