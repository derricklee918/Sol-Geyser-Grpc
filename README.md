# How can I use Geyser support grpc in Solana Trading Bots?

Hi, guys.
The Solana Geyser grpc is the best way to fetch blocks and transactions that creating new pools and balance changes and such things in pumpfun and raydium dex platforms as they are processed by the validator.
This repo is showing the 4 various methods using helius-websocket, hello-moon-websocket, grpc-websocket(provided by helius) to catch the newly created pools and also balance updating.
I have used these methods in my pump.fun and raydium sniping projects.
If you want my help in using these methods, plz contact me
